# 7-14. for Loop in List

## a. Loop through just list element values
Syntax: for <loop_variable> in <list_name>:
```python
programming_languages = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "C++"]
for language in programming_languages:
  print(language)
```

  Second line has the for loop going over the list<br>
  Python will read it as, "As long as there are elements in the list keep going"<br><br>
  
  The first time for loop executes, it prints the first element - Javascript<br>
  And checks, are there more elements? YES!<br><br>
  Then it loops again, and this time it prints the second element - Python<br>
  And checks, are there more elements? YES!<br><br>
  Then it loops again, and this time it prints the third element - Java<br>
  And checks, are there more elements? YES!<br><br>
  Then it loops again, and this time it prints the fourth element - C++<br>
  And checks, are there more elements? NO!<br><br>
  So it stops and program execution ends<br>

Use a for loop to print each element of the list<br>
employee = ["28678", "Bob Singer", "HR", [90, 95, 67], ["Manager", "Supervisor", "Team Leader"]]

```python
for value in employee:
  print(value)
```

I have used value as my variable name, you may choose any name as long as the list name is correct

## b. Loop through list element values and indexes
Syntax: for <index_name>, <value_name> in enumerate(<list_name>):

```python
programming_languages = ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "C++"]
for index, language in enumerate(programming_languages):
  print(index, '->', language)
```
