# 10-6. Mutator Methods
These methods let us modify the attributes. These are void methods.

### a. Defining mutator methods
- Coding convention encourages to define mutator methods with the prefix **set**
- All method definitions will be INSIDE the class

  
```python
# Defining a public mutator method
def set_name(self, new_name):
  self.__name = new_name

# Defining a protected mutator method
def _set_name(self, new_name):
  self.__name = new_name

# Defining a private mutator method
def __set_name(self, new_name):
  self.__name = new_name
```
### b. Calling the public mutator methods
- Method calls will be outside the class definition
- We must use the object name to call the method
```python
# Outside the class
new_name = input("Enter the new name: ")
student1.set_name(new_name)

# @TODO - Print the name
# Hint: Must use the accessor method
```

### c. Calling the private mutator methods
- Method calls will be INSIDE the class definition, usually made by other methods.
- For the scope of this class, we will not be using these

  Inside class definition,<br>

  1. Every method inside a class must have first parameter as self<br>
  2. To call any method, you must first create the object and use object to call that method
