# 3-1. Decision Structures
So far, we have written Python programs that are sequence structures  
A **sequence structure** is a set of statements that execute sequentially    
But some situations cannot be solved by sequential steps, but based on decision-making    

We see such real life examples all the time -    
If the light is green, we have to **GO**  
If the light is orange, we have to **SLOW DOWN**  
If the light is red, we have to **STOP**  

To implement situations like this, we must use a decision structure or selection structure  

The decision structure used in Python is **if statement**
