# 10-1. Classes and Objects

Class is a description of an objectâ€™s characteristics  
An object is an instance of a class  
To create a class, we write a class definition.  
A class definition is a set of statements that define a classâ€™s **data attributes** and **methods**

### 1a. Creating class
Class definition will always be at zero indent  

**Syntax:** class <class_name>():
```python
class student():
  pass
# Good coding convention is to start class name with uppercase character, so let's fix it
```

### 1b. Now we create the object of this class
Must do it OUTSIDE the class definition  

**Syntax:** <obj_name> = <class_name>()  

```python
student1 = Student()
```
