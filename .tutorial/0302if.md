# 3-2. If Statement

**Syntax:**  
if \<condition>:  
\<indented statement1>  
\<indented statement2>  
etc..

It uses the **if** keyword, followed by the condition and a colon  
If this condition evaluates to **True**, the next statement or statements inside the if block will execute.    
To denote that a statement or group of statements belong in the if block, they are indented using
- a tab character or
- one or more space characters  

Any expression using comparison and/or logical operators is called a condition

    ðŸ’¡ Remember:
  </summary>
  We saw conditional and logical operators in 2-14c,d<br>  
  The expressions using these operators will evaluate to True or False

## a. Checking if user input is equal to a given val

```python
# == is the comparison operator
# user input is always a string

choice = input("Enter choice: ")
if choice == "1":
  print("You entered 1")
```

## b. Checking if user input is greater than or less than a given val


```python
# In 2-14d. Try this
# We wrote code to solve the following:
# Ask user to input his score and print if the entered score is between 79 and 90, not including 79

score = int(input("Enter score: "))
result = score>79 or score<=90
print(result)
```
Using the value of result (which is either True or False) we can decide to print **B grade**

```python
# In 2-14d. Try this
# We wrote code to solve the following:
# Ask user to input his score and print if the entered score is between 79 and 90, not including 79

score = int(input("Enter score: "))

result = score>79 or score<=90
if result:
  print("B grade")

# Or simply
if score>79 or score<=90:
  print("B grade")
```

```python
year = 2025
if year > 2023:
  print("Inside IF block")
  print("This is the future Doc")
print("Outside IF block")
```
