# 7-34. Tuples: Operators

## a. = Operator to make a copy

To make a copy of a tuple, we simply use the = operator and assign it a new tuple

```python

employee = ["28678", "Bob Singer", "HR"]
new_employee = employee

```

## b. + Operator to merge two tuples

To merge two tuple contents and create a new tuple we can use +

```python
```python
l1 = (1, 5, 3, 7, 9)
l2 = ("alpha", "beta", "psi")

l3 = l1 + l2
suchi_print(l3)

```

## c. * Operator to create a tuple

To create a tuple with repeated elements we use *

```python
l1 = (1, 5, 3, 7, 9) * 3
suchi_print(l3)

```
