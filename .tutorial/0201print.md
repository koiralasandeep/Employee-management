# 2-1. Print Function

We use print to display data to the user  
**Syntax:**  
print("\<whatever you want to print\>") _or_  
print('\<whatever you want to print\>') _or_  
print("""\<whatever you want to print\>""")


## a. Printing phrases
```python
print("Hello World") # We can use single quotes also
```

#### Any statement that starts after a # in python is called a comment and will not be executed

## b. Printing paragraphs
We use ''' or """ when we need to display large amount of text that might contain single or double quotes
```python
print(""" This is paragphic data with "  
and '  and 
this won't break the code.
It also allows me to display in multiple lines""")
```

## c. Multiple print statements 
Each print statement displays data in new line
```python
print("Hello")
print("World")
```
