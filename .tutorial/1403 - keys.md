# 14-3. Primary Keys, Identity Columns, NULL

## a. Primary Keys

**Primary Key** is a column that can be used to identify a specific row. Primary keys must hold unique values  
e.g. SSN for people etc or CWID for ULM students

Primary keys MUST contain a value  

You can create a table without a primary key, but best practice is to always have a primary key  

Primary keys can be used to establish relationships between tables

|Name   	| Major  	| GPA  |  CWID  |
|----------------	|--------------	|---------------	| ----------- |
|John Smith   | HIST 	  |  2.45 	| 30010100 |
|  Jane Doe 	|  HIST 	|   	| 30010101 |
|  Mia Rose 	|  CINS 	|  3.27 	| 30010102 |
|  John Smith | COSC    |  3.42   | 30010103 |

## b. Identity Columns
Sometimes data may not contain a primary key, which uniquely identifies a row  
An identity column is a column that contains unique values that are generated by the DBMS  
Identity columns usually contain integers that are *autoincremented*  
e.g. Order number of Amazon order  
Confirmation number for airline ticket

## c. Allowing Null values
If a column contains no data, it is said to be null. It is okay for a column to be left empty. For example, if you are a freshman, you will not have a GPA yet, until after the semester ends  

Some columns such as 

When you design a table, you can apply a *constraint* or rule that prevents a column from being null. Failing to provide data for that column will result in an error  

### We will learn how to design tables using SQL statementsthat can have
- columns with different datatypes
- primary keys that can be auto incremented
- columns that MUST have data (like name, gender etc.)
