# 8-0. Intro to Strings

1. A string is a textual data in Python. According to Python anything between a single or double or triple quotes is a string.
```python
string1 = 'Hello'
string2 = " my dear"
string3 = ''' Watson'''
```

  Triple quotes let us print paragraphs of data

2. So far we have seen string operations primarily with print() and input()

  print is a void function<br>
  input is a value-returning function which accepts one string and returns one string

3. Strings are immutable, you cannot modify a string once you create it.

4. Strings are a type of sequence (just like lists or tuples). So, many concepts we have seen so far with sequences also work on Strings
