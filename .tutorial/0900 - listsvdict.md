# 9-0. Dictionary vs Lists/Tuples

- Object that stores a collection of data just like a list
- Each element in a dictionary consists of a key and a value
- Lists also had keys (or indexes, 0, 1, 2, .. etc) but Python assigned those as we added values

```python
student = ["Mary Kay", "kay@ulm.edu"]
# student.append("CINS")
# suchi_print(student)
```
- If we want human-readable keys for our data, we use dictionaries
  
```python
# Dictionary has key:value pairs
student = {"name" : "Mary Kay",
            "email" : "kay@ulm.edu"}
# suchi_print(student)
```
