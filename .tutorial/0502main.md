# 5-2. main() function

It is important to have main() function in a modularized program  
main() is in main.py
The main function is called when the program starts    
The main function then calls other functions in the program as they are needed   
The main function contains a program’s **mainline logic**  
The main function is Python's in-built void function

    🔎 Closer Look:
  </summary>
  def is a keyword in Python and needs to be in that exact case<br><br>
  main is a built-in function name in Python and you cannot use Main or MAIN or any other case, except main in all lowercase<br><br>
  The open/close paratheses denote that this is a function<br><br>
  : denotes that a block of statements could be following<br>
  (Similar to IF or FOR statements)<br><br>
  
  Every statement after this should be one indent to the right<br>
  All statements are executed sequentially<br>
  For now, we have only one statement that prints Hello World

## b. Calling main()
Defining is a function is not enough  
We must "call it" for the statement(s) to be executed  
main() must be called outside its definition
