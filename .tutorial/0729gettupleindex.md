# 7-29. Accessing Tuple Index Using Value

## Syntax: \<tuple_name\>.index(\<element_value\>)
- The index method is a value-returning method
  
```python
# To find the index position of James Smith in the tuple

student = (123678, "James Smith", "COSC", 3.67, [90, 95, 67])
index_position = student.index("James Smith")

# This has to be case-sensitive
```
