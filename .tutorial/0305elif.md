# 3-5. If-Elif-Else Statement
First the if statement condition is evaluated.  
If it is true, the if block is executed.  
If false, the elif condition is evaluated.  
If true, the elif block is executed.  
If false, the else block is executed.  
We can have multiple elif blocks.

### Syntax:
```
if condition:
  statement
elif condition:
  statement
else:
  statement
```

### Example:

```python
light = input("Enter the light color: ")
if light == "red":
  print("Stop")
elif light == "orange":
  print("Slow Down")
elif light == "green":
  print("Go")
else:
  print("Invalid color")
```

    ðŸ”Ž Closer look:
  </summary>
  We accept the user input for light color<br>
  We check if the color is red<br>
  If that is True, the control goes to the print statement that displays Stop<br>
  If not, the control jumps to the elif that checks if the color is orange<br>
  If that is True, the control goes to the print statement that displays Slow Down<br>
  If not, the control jumps to the elif that checks if the color is green<br>
  If that is True, the control goes to the print statement that displays Go<br>
  If not, the control jumps to the else block that has the print statement to display Invalid color
