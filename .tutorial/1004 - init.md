# 10-3. init method
This is a built-in Python **initializer** method  
Any data when creating an object is initialized by this method  
This is usually the first method in a class  

**Syntax:**  
def \_\_init\_\_(self, \<other parameters\>):  

__Every method must have the first parameter variable named self__  

When a method executes, it must have a way of knowing which objectâ€™s data attributes it is supposed to operate on. Thatâ€™s where the self parameter comes in. 
 
 When a method is called, Python makes the self parameter reference the specific object that the method is supposed to operate on.

### 3a. Defining \_\_init\_\_
```python
def __init__(self, name, major):
  # init binds the name, major to self
  
  self.name = name  # public attribute
  self.major = major # public attribute

  # self.name = _name  # protected attribute
  # self.major = _major # protected attribute

  # self.__name = name  # private attribute
  # self.__major = major # private attribute
```

    ðŸš© To remember:
  </summary>
  Every method in a class must have the first parameter variable named self
</details>
### How to call the \_\_init\_\_ method?
\_\_init\_\_ is a private method, so we cannot access it from outside the class  
Only way to call it is by passing data when creating object
 
### 3b. Calling \_\_init\_\_

```python
student1 = Student("John", "CINS")
print(student1.name)
# student1 is an object of the class student
# student1 is passed as self
# name and major are bound to student1 in __init__

```
self.name and self.major are called method attibutes

    ðŸ’¡ Note:
  </summary>
  Method attibutes hold different values for different objects
</details>

```python
# Let's create another student
student2 = Student("Mia", "HIST")
print(student2.name)
```

OOP is specifically meant to disallow data manipulation from unintended code

```python
print(student1.name)
student1.name = "Joe"
print(student1.name)
```
To try to avoid this, we have to indicate the attributes are private by using leading and trailing \_\_  
*For the scope of this chapter, we will make all our method attributes private*  
Next chapter, we will use a combination of private and protected method attributes


```python
def __init__(self, name, major):
  self.__name = name
  self.__major = major
```
