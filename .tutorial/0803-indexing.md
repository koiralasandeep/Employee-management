# 8-3. Indexing in Strings

- This is similar to that of lists
- Indexing is using an integer index to access elements
- In strings, each character is an element
- Index always starts at 0

```python
# Print the fifth character in this string
string = "The Hunger Games"
fifth_char = string[4]
```

  <summary>ðŸ’¡ Remember</summary>If you try to access an index that doesn't exist, Python will raise an exception
