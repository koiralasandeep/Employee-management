# 7-1. Intro

## Sequence
- A sequence is an object that holds multiple items of data, stored one after the other
- There are several different types of sequence objects in Python
- Each sequence is distinguished by three characteristics
  - Order
  - Mutability
  - Duplicity (having duplicate values)

## Lists and Tuples

- In this chapter, we will look at two sequences: lists and tuples
- Lists/Tuples can contain any arbitrary number of elements, of any datatypes
- The only difference between lists and tuples is mutability
  - Lists are mutable, which means that a program can change its contents
  - Tuples are immutable, which means that once created, a tuple's contents cannot be changed.
