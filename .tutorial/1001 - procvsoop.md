# 10-0. Intro to OOP
Two styles of programming in use

## 1. Procedural
   - procedure aka function performs a specific task
   - procedures operate on data items that are **separate from** the procedures
   - as the program becomes larger, the separation of data and the code can lead to problems
   - examples: C, Basic
     
## 2. Object-oriented
   - is centered on creating objects
   - object is a software entity that contains both data aka attributes and procedures aka methods
   - this binding of attributes and methods is called encapsulation
   - to create an object we must define a class
   - class is a template that each object uses
   - for example, if CINS 3002 is a class, each student enrolled is an object
   - examples: Java
