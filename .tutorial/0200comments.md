# 2-0. Comments

In Python if we don't want to execute any line of code, we place a # at the beginning of the line  
Such a line is called a **comment**  
We use comments in our code to leave ourselves some notes about the program  
If you use a # in the middle of a line of code, Python ignores everything to the right of the #

```python
# this is a comment
# and will not be executed
```

In replit, you can use the shortcut Ctrl + / to toggle commenting of your code  
You can comment one line or multiple lines  
Highlight the lines you want to comment or uncomment and press Ctrl + /
