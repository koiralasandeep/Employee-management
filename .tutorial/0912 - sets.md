# 9-12. Sets

## Characteristcs:
- Sets store a collection of data
- Sets are unordered
- Sets are mutable
- Sets do not have duplicate values
  
## 1. Create an empty set

```python
my_set = set() 
print(my_set)
print(type(my_set))
```

<details>
  <summary>
    ðŸ’¡ Remember
  </summary>
  lists was []<br>
  tuple was (,)<br>
  dict was {}
</details>

## 2a. Creating a set with values

```python
colors = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
suchi_print(colors)
```

## 2b. convert other iterables to a set
### a. list
```python
my_list = [25, 30, 25, 40]
my_set = set(my_list)
suchi_print(my_set)
```

### b. tuple
```python
my_tuple = (25, 30, 25, 40)
my_set = set(my_tuple)
suchi_print(my_set)
```

### c. dictionary
```python
my_dict = {1:25, 2:30, 3:25, 4:40, 5:25}
my_set = set(my_dict)
suchi_print(my_set)
```

### d. string
```python
my_string = "Hello"
my_set = set(my_string)
suchi_print(my_set)
```

## 3. len()
```python
my_set = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
suchi_print(len(my_set))
```

## 4. modifying set elements

### a. add()
Adds element to a set
```python
my_set = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
my_set.add("purple")
suchi_print(my_set)
```

### b. update()
Adds elelments of iterable to set
```python
my_set = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}

my_set.update({"green", "pink"})
# my_set.update([25,35, "pink"])
# my_set.update((25,30))
# my_set.update({1:25, 2:30, 3:25, 4:40, 5:25})
# my_set.update('hello')

suchi_print(my_set)
```

### c. remove()
Removes an element, raises an exception if not found
```python
my_set = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
my_set.remove("green")
suchi_print(my_set)
```

### d. discard()
Removes an element, doesn't raise exception
```python
my_set = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
my_set.discard("green")
suchi_print(my_set)
```

## 5. Loop through a set
```python
colors = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
for val in colors:
  print(val)
```

## 6. Some set methods
### a. copy()
Creates a copy of our student
```python
colors = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
new_colors = colors.copy()
print(new_colors)
```

### b. clear()
Removes all the elements of the set
```python
my_set = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
my_set.clear()
print(my_set)
```

### c. pop()
Removes the first element and returns the first element
```python
my_set = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
print(my_set.pop())
print(my_set)
```

## 7. Set Union
Returns a set that contains all the elements of both sets
```python
set1 = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
set2 = {"purple", "red", "green"}
print(set1.union(set2))
print(set1 | set2) # Using operator
```

## 8. Set Intersection
Returns a set that contains only the elements found in both sets
```python
set1 = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
set2 = {"purple", "red", "green"}
print(set1.intersection(set2))
print(set1 & set2) # Using operator
```

## 9. Set Difference
Returns a set that contains the elements that appear in the first set but do not appear in the second set
```python
set1 = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
set2 = {"purple", "red", "green"}
diff1 = set1.difference(set2)
# diff1 = set1 - set2  # Using operator

diff2 = set2.difference(set1)
# diff2 = set2 - set1   # Using operator
 
```

## 10. Set Symmetric Difference
Returns a set that contains the elements that are not shared by the two sets
```python
set1 = {"blue", "red", "yellow"}
set2 = {"purple", "red", "green"}
print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))
print(set2.symmetric_difference(set1))
print(set1 ^ set2) # Using operator
print(set2 ^ set1) # Using operator
```

## 11. Finding subset
set1 is subset of set2 if all the elements in set1 are included in set2
```python
student_courses = {"acct101","acct501"}
courses_offered = {"acct101","acct201","acct301","acct401","acct501"}
print(student_courses.issubset(courses_offered))
```

## 12. Finding superset
set1 is superset of set2 if all the elements in set2 are included in set1
```python
student_courses = {"acct601","acct401"}
courses_offered = {"acct101","acct201","acct301","acct401","acct501"}
print(courses_offered.issuperset(student_courses))
```
