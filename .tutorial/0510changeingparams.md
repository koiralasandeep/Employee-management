# 5-10. Making Changes to Parameters

We have seen that when an argument is passed to a function, the function parameter variable will reference the argumentâ€™s value<br><br>
But, any changes that are made to the parameter variable inside the function will not affect the argument

```python

def main():
  value = 99
  print(f'Before change me call: {value}')
  change_me(value)
  print(f'After change me call: {value}')

def change_me(arg):
  arg = 0
  print(f'Inside change me function: {arg}')
 
main()
```

    ðŸ”Ž Closer look
  </summary>
The main function creates a local variable named value with value 99<br>
The print statement 'Before change me call: 99'<br>
The value variable is passed as an argument to the change_me function<br>
This means that in the change_me function, the arg parameter will also reference the value 99<br>
Inside the change_me function, the arg parameter is assigned the value 0<br>
This reassignment changes arg, but it does not affect the value variable in main<br>
The two variables now reference different values in memory. The print statement  'Inside change me function: 0'<br>
And the function ends<br>
Control of the program then returns to the main function<br>
The print statement displays 'After change me call: 99'<br>
This proves that even though the parameter variable arg was changed in the change_me function, the argument (the value variable in main) was not modified.

  </summary>
  This form of argument passing, where a function cannot change the value of an argument that was passed to it, is called pass by value

So far we have seen that the calling function can communicate with the called function, but the called function cannot use the argument to communicate with the calling function.<br><br>
Later in this chapter, we will see how to write a function that can communicate with the part of the program that called it by returning a value
