# 6-3. Reading from files

Before reading from a file, we must open the file in "r" mode  
If no mode is specified, the default is read mode  
**Syntax**: <file_pointer> = open("\<file_name\>", "r")

    🚩 To remember
  </summary>
  When opening file in read mode, make sure the file exists, otherwise it will give an error (or in correct terms - raise an exception)
</details>

```python
fp = open('data.txt')
# fp = open('data.txt','r')
```

  fp is a variable and is called file pointer<br>
  open() - is a built-in Python function to open a file<br>
  open takes atleast one required argument, file name along with the full path<br>
  file name must be specified in single or double quotes<br>
  second argument - mode is optional<br>
  if you want to specify the read mode, you must use "r" inside single or double quotes
</details>

When a file is opened in read mode
- it is called an input file
- the read position is at the beginning of the file

## a. read() method - without arguments

```python
fp = open("data.txt", "r")
contents = fp.read()
print(contents)
fp.close()
```

read() will read the **entire** file contents into the memory.  
This is not good when we are reading large files.

## b. read() - with integer argument
We can use read() method to read only specified number of characters

```python
fp = open("data.txt", "r")
print(fp.tell()) # this will tell us the current location of the read position
contents = fp.read(5)
print(contents)
print(fp.tell()) # this will tell us the current location of the read position
contents = fp.read(5)
print(contents)
print(fp.tell())
fp.seek(0)  # this will move the read position to 0
contents = fp.read(5)
print(contents)
print(fp.tell())
fp.close()
```

  tell() gives the location of the read position<br>
  seek() will move the read position to the desired location
</details>

## c. readline()
Reads one line and advances the read position to the beginning of the next line

```python
fp = open("data.txt", "r")
line1 = fp.readline()
print(line1)

line2 = fp.readline()
print(line2)

# why is there an additional blank line?
# that is because of the newline we added
# so we need to remove it
fp.close()
```

  Open the students.txt and print the first four lines separated by |<br>
  For example: <br>

  ```python
  infile = open("students.txt", "r")
  name = infile.readline().rstrip("\n")
  major = infile.readline().rstrip("\n")
  gpa = infile.readline().rstrip("\n")
  print(name, major, gpa, sep="|")
  infile.close()
  ```
</details>

## d. Using for loop
For loop will read each line in the file until there are no more lines

```python
fp = open("data.txt", "r")
for line in fp:
  print(line.rstrip("\n"))
fp.close()
```

  When we use a for loop over a file pointer, the loop variable stores each line<br>
</details>


To make for loop read every other line (instead of every line) we can sneak in a readline()

```python
fp = open("data.txt", "r")
for line in fp:
  print(line.rstrip("\n"))
  fp.readline() # moves the pointer to the next line
fp.close()
```

  Using for loop print just the names and majors of the students in students.txt

  ```python
  fp = open("data.txt", "r")
  for line in fp:
    print(line.rstrip("\n")) # print the first line
    fp.readline() # skip the second line
    print(fp.readline().rstrip("\n")) # print the third line
  fp.close()
  ```

## e. readlines() method
This method reads file contents into a list  
We won't go over this method for this class

```python
fp = open("data.txt", "r")
data_list = fp.readlines()
print(data_list)
fp.close()
```
