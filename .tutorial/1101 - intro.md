# Intro to Inheritance
- Inheritance allows a new class to extend an existing class. the new class inherits the members of the class it extends
- This is like a parent and child relationship.
- The child class (also called subclass or derived class) inherits all the properties of the parent class (superclass or base class) and can also have its own properties


## Why inheritance?
- When one object is a specialized version of another object, there is an "is a " relationship betweeen them.
- Through inheritance we can "clone" an existing class and all its attributes and methods and then add our own attrbiutes and methods

## For example:

- A college student has attributes name, major, classification and GPA
- If this student were to take the class CINS 3002, then in addition to name, major, classification, gpa he/she will have attributes to store the scores specific to this class, i.e.
  - video quiz
  - homework
  - exam
- So it makes no sense to create a class for CINS3002 student and repeat the attributes that are already stored by Student class
- Instead, a sub class or child of Student can be created which
  - "inherits" name, major, classification and gpa AND
  - can also define its own attributes (or methods)
- Similarly with CINS 3006, which has its own set of attributes

  Through inheritance we can "clone" an existing class and all its attributes and methods and then add our own attrbiutes and methods<br>
The class we clone is called the parent (or super class) and the new class created is called a child (or sub class)

## Different types of inheritance
1. Single Inheritance - (parent-child)

2. Mutliple Inheritance - (parent-parent-child)

3. Multi-Level Inheritance - (parent-child-grandchild)

### Without inheritance

Let's look at two classes
  
```python
class Student():
  def __init__(self):
    print("This is Student init")

class CINS_Student(): 
  pass
```
- Let us create an object of Student
- init gets called and the print statement is executed
  
```python
student1 = Student()
```

Now let us create an object of CINS_Student

```python
cins = CINS_Student()
```

This class doesn't have an init method, so nothing is displayed
