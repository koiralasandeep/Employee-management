# 4-4. While loop
A while loop is a repetitive structure that is used when the number of times the loop needs to run is determined at run-time  
For example, in our runner example, instead of giving the runner a specific number of laps to run, what if, the runner is asked to run laps until the user says "stop" and eat a banana for each lap?

## Syntax:
```python
[initial_condition]  
while [check_condition]:  
  [perform_actions]  
  [change_conditon]
```

  While loop has 3 important components to work<br>
  Otherwise, the program will run indefinitely

```python
action = "run" # initial condition
while action != "stop": # checking the condition so it evaluates to True
  print("Eat a banana")
  action = input("Continue? (run/stop): ")
```
